# minimalistic-javascript
 A small collection of handwritten javascript for browsers  
 (These were all written in 2018 and could be outdated or simply badly written)  

## gallery
Simply move pictures in the "pictures" folder and visit gallery.html.  
The pictures will be displayed in square divs and are only loading if you can see them. This helps lower server load because users are not loading all images on the page at once.

## linux-console
This should be a rebuild of a linux console in your browser. It's still a work-in-progress as it's difficult to make everything at once and in a good way.

## reader
This should be a minimalistic web-reader for manga. You put each manga in a folder in the "manga" directory and the images themselves in another folder for the chapters.  
This makes the directory structure manga->bleach->Chapter1->picture.png  

## music
A small music player in your browser. It fetches the music files from a web directory (apache2 default directory listing) and puts them in a list for you to listen to.
